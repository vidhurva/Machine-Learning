# Creating my own Machine Learning Project

After following the two tutorials that are mentioned in my other two classifications, I develop my own project with machine learning. In my project, I create training data to determine which quantitative values belong to which drink. The first number in the 'features' variable contain sample pH levels and a value that identifies what category belongs to each drink. For example, '7.0, 1' indicates that the pH is 7.0 and the category is 1. The category key is listed below:

1 = water
2 = vodka
3 = gin
4 = pepsi
5 = ros√©

After that, I use a decision tree classifier in order to find patterns in the data set. Finally, I create predictions based on the training data by adding two other pieces of data. The predictions are then printed out. I intentionally left the second feature as '5' while changing the pH number to see if a difference would develop. As a result, both predictions outputted 'rose', meaning that the category number likely dominates the pH category when classifying data.



# Machine Learning using Python on Classifying Fruits

I explore the applications of Machine Learning using Python. This program was inspired by the, "Hello World-Machine Learning Recipes #1" video from Google Developers.

In this program, I import the sklearn library, along with the tree in order to enable a decision tree. In the label section of my code, although the tutorial used binary, I used a strings in order for the output to produce a specific name of the object, rather than a binary value.

# Machine Learning using Python on Classifying Iris flowers

I continue exploring machine learning using the, "Hello World-Machine Learning Recipes #1" video from Google Developers.

In this program, I implement a program from a dataset that has been given from skitlearn on classifying different types of flowers. Based on the given feature names, a name is configured to specify which flower is which. 

# End Goal:
Ultimately, this tutorial allowed me to gain an applicative experience of machine learning, which I will later conduct as a personal project.
